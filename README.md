# Predicting Obesity Status
Accurately predicting obesity allows for early
identification of individuals at risk, enabling timely
interventions and preventative measures to be taken,
potentially reducing the development of obesity-related
health complications later in life.

This study performs an exploratory data analysis on a
dataset with a large sample size to classify the individuals’
obesity status as “Obese” or “Not Obese.” Statistics and
machine learning techniques are used to perform a
comprehensive investigation on the dataset.
