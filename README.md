# Predicting Obesity Status
Accurately predicting obesity allows for early
identification of individuals at risk, enabling timely
interventions and preventative measures to be taken,
potentially reducing the development of obesity-related
health complications later in life.

This study performs an exploratory data analysis on a
dataset with a large sample size to classify the individuals’
obesity status as “Obese” or “Not Obese.” Statistics and
machine learning techniques are used to perform a
comprehensive investigation on the dataset.


# Obesity Classification Using SQL and R

This project predicts obesity status using health, demographic, and behavioral data. The goal is to build interpretable and accurate models that can classify individuals as Obese or Not Obese. We use SQL for preprocessing and R for statistical modeling and machine learning.

## Project Overview

- Dataset size: 42,686 observations
- Features: 29 predictors and 1 response variable
- Classification task: Obese vs Not Obese
- Technologies: SQLite (via SQL), R (caret, randomForest, RSQLite)

## File Structure

- setup_sqlite_extended_corrected.R: Creates a SQLite database and performs missing value imputation using SQL
- obesity_modeling_extended_corrected.R: Loads cleaned data and builds a Random Forest model in R
- obesity_db.sqlite: SQLite database generated by the setup script
- ObesityTrain2.csv: Training data
- ObesityTestNoY2.csv: Testing data

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing with SQL

- Numerical missing values were replaced using the column mean
- Categorical missing values were replaced using the most frequent category (mode)
- Cleaned data was saved in new tables within a local SQLite database

### Modeling in R

- Random Forest model with 1,000 trees using the caret package
- Cross-validation was used to improve generalization
- Predictors used included age, height, gender, meal and drinking habits, and physical activity

## Results

| Model                | Training Accuracy | Test Error Rate | Notes                              |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | ~74%              | 25.3%           | Simple and interpretable            |
| Lasso Logistic      | ~74%              | 25.9%           | Sparse and interpretable            |
| Random Forest       | ~99.9%            | ~0.64%          | Most accurate but less interpretable|

## Key Findings

- The most important predictors included water intake, frequency of high-calorie food, and physical activity
- SQL was useful for scalable data cleaning
- Random Forest captured complex relationships better than linear models

## Limitations

- The dataset may not represent a globally diverse population
- Simple mean/mode imputation might introduce bias
- Only a limited set of models was tested

## Future Work

- Try additional models like SVM and Gradient Boosting
- Include longitudinal data and wearable health metrics
- Improve handling of missing data using more sophisticated techniques
